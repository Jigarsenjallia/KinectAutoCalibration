This is an application to calibrate the Kinect.

Input are pairs of RGB and IR images of a chessboard. 
The nice thing about this implementation is the lack
of needed userinput. Since the raw IR-image is used, 
the chessboardcorners can be detected automatically 
(at least in about 90% when I tried). 

The images can be easily generated with my fork of
https://github.com/arturoc/ofxKinect 

ofxKinect is an addon for openFrameworks, so this
has to be installed for generating these images. 
(how to generate images is described in my fork)

This calibration uses some functions from openCV, 
which is the only library needed. 

The code should be self explaining :)

It only expects pairs of RGB and (raw) IR images.
There is no failcheck if the corners in one image can't
be detected. If it happens, some error message is printed
and you should remove these images from the input folder
(both ir and rgb) and make sure that there is still
a consecutive order of filenames (i.e. replace the
deleted images with the ones with the highest number).

All parameters are written in .xml files, more info
on the used functions and the output format can be found
at http://opencv.willowgarage.com/documentation/index.html

implementation was mine :)
